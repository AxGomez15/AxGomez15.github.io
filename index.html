        <h3>Origin</h3>
        <p>
            My family comes from a small pueblo south of Guadalajara, Jalisco called Huejotitan. However, my family decided to migrate to the United States to have better oppurtunities for themselves and for their children. I was born in San Jose, California and raised in East Side San Jose. My family positively affected me because they made me care about my educationa and my future and I hope I could someday return the favor.
            <h3>Current Position</h3>
            Today, I currently attend Alpha: Cindy Avitia High School and I am a founding ninth-grade student. At Alpha, it is always a struggle, but as a community we all know that together we can struggle, overcome, and thrive. I also spend a lot of time with my family and makes me feel blessed for having such a great family like the one I have.
